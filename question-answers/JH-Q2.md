I used the brute force debugging strategy to create the TestDriver class.

## ii

I used the brute force strategy because:

1. this is a small program,
2. it reports the major issues immediately
3. my lack of experience with Java programming makes it more challenging for me to use other methods.

Backtracking would be another effective debugging strategy for the TestDriver class.
